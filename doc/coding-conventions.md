Coding Conventions
==================

_(also known as the **Ledger of Arbitrary Decisions**)_

Bayou uses a JavaScript style which is trending towards (but is not exactly)
the style defined by the [Airbnb JavaScript Style
Guide](http://airbnb.io/javascript/).

Highlights of the style:

* two-space indents

* semicolon-terminated statements

* single-quoted strings

* Java-ish bracing and spacing (K&amp;R / [1TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS_.28OTBS.29)
  variant)

As an historical note, the project originally intended to approximate the
style described by the [Google JavaScript Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml). However, the
Airbnb style turns out to hew more closely to modern trends, including notably
taking into account recent additions to the language.
