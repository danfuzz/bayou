Terminology
===========

Within the code, there are a few terms that are used which warrant further
explanation.

* "document" &mdash; The high-level thing that this system works with.

* "file" &mdash; The medium in which a document is stored.

* "file store" &mdash; Where files are stored. Roughly speaking, this is the
  filesystem, though this system implements deeper semantics beyond just a
  flat file of bytes.
