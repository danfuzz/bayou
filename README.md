Bayou
=====

Bayou is a collaborative document editor, which uses [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)
on the front end. It includes synchronization of document state across multiple
clients. **It is a work in progress.**

### Theory of operation

See the [client state diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danfuzz/bayou-docs/master/client-states.png)
for an overview of how the system operates from the client's perspective. This
is a straightforward (fairly unsurprising) operational-transform implementation.
