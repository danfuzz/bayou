Bayou
=====

Bayou is a collaborative document editor, which uses [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)
on the front end. It includes synchronization of document state across multiple
clients. **It is a work in progress.**

### Theory of operation

See the [client state diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danfuzz/bayou-docs/master/client-states.png)
for an overview of how the system operates from the client's perspective. This
is a straightforward (fairly unsurprising) operational-transform implementation.

### Customization

The code is set up to make it straightforward to customize. Salient details:

* Quill and its dependencies get built from source, instead of being used in
  the precompiled distro form which Quill provides as a convenience. This makes
  it possible to use Quill and Parchment (and the other dependencies) from
  custom code without ending up with duplicated code and punned definitions.

* All of the client-side code gets transformed into a single bundle, using
  [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It is set up in a "live development"
  configuration, where changes to source files cause the bundle to be recompiled
  on the fly.

* Custom client code can be written in either ES2017 (with a `.js` suffix) or
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (with a `.ts` suffix). Custom
  server code can be written in ES2017. Modern `import` syntax works both for
  separate modules (e.g., `import Quill from 'quill'`) and local files (e.g.,
  `import { thing } from './thing'`).

  * ES2017 is compiled into conservative JavaScript by
    [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

  * TypeScript is compiled into conservative JavaScript by the standard
    TS compiler, hooked up to Webpack using
    [`ts-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-loader).

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is used as the HTTP server and associated
  plumbing.

* The product defines and uses a structured (though as yet not particularly
  well-specified) API for communication between client and server. It uses a
  websocket for transport, using it to pass JSON-encoded API calls and
  responses. As of this writing, the server side only _barely_ does anything
  nontrivial. The intention is to continue expanding the server-side
  functionality over time.

* This project is meant to form the core for a more complete product that
  integrates into a larger system. As such, it intentionally punts on document
  storage, user authentication, and the like. Instead, the project provides
  mechanisms to help integrate these things without having to fork the original
  source code:

  * The `build` script takes an optional `--overlay` option, which specifies
    a directory to use for additional sources. There are two main things that
    can be accomplished with overlays. Namelyâ€¦

  * The project provides a number of predefined hooks, both on the client and
    server side. By default, the hooks are all no-ops. However, the overlay can
    contain replacements for these hooks. Hooks are located in the local modules
    `hooks-client` and `hooks-server`. If the overlay directory contains either
    `local-modules/hooks-client/main.js` or
    `local-modules/hooks-server/main.js`, then those files will be used instead
    of the no-op versions built into the base source.

  * Because no amount of explicit configuration hooks will ever turn out to be
    fully adequate, any original source file at all can be overridden with a
    replacement. This probably means a lot of copy-paste code duplication, but
    it will at least unblock progress while still allowing the upstream source
    to remain unforked. Should you find yourself in need of this facility,
    please do not hesitate to file an issue, as this is a good indicator that
    the project is in need of a new hook to cover the use case in question.
