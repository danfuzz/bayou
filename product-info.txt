# Artificial Failure
#
# Change / uncomment the appropriate bits below in order to induce artificial
# failures, e.g. for testing and for deployment/rollback drills.
#

# The proportion of servers which should experience the failure. Uncomment this
# (and set to the desired level) to enable artificial failure. Recommendation:
# If actually deploying into production, it is probably not a good idea to set
# this higher than 50.

# artificial_failure_percent = 25

# What sort of failure to experience. To induce failure, uncomment the line with
# the desired failure type.

# No actual failure, but log stuff as if things are going wrong.
# artificial_failure_type = just_logging
