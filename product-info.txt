# Artificial Failure
#
# Change the following lines in order to induce artificial failures, e.g. for
# testing and for deployment/rollback drills.
#

# The proportion of servers which should experience the failure. Recommendation:
# If actually deploying into production, it is probably not a good idea to set
# this higher than 50.
artificial_failure_percent = 0

# What sort of failure to experience. To induce failure, comment out the line
# immediately below, and uncomment the line with the desired failure type.
artificial_failure_type = none

# No actual failure, but log stuff as if things are going wrong.
# artificial_failure_type = just_logging
