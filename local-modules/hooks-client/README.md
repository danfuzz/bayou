hooks-client
============

This module contains all the "official" customization hooks that are made
available on the client side.

The default implementation suffices for developing Bayou in a standalone
fashion, but by and large it won't work for real production use.

A downstream product should replace this module (or parts) with implementations
that are more appropriate for deploying that product by the downstream
organization.
