/**
 * Base class for representation of a change to document content. A change
 * consists of four parts:
 *
 * * the revision number (of the document or document part) produced by the
 *   change when applied in context.
 *
 * * a delta (instructions for change), which describes the details of the
 *   change from the document's contextually-defined previous state. The context
 *   is sometimes (but not always) the immediately-previous revision of the
 *   document. The other typical context is an _expected_ document based on
 *   an attempt to apply an update.
 *
 * * an optional timestamp, which specifies the moment in time when the change
 *   was created (e.g. by an end user). This is only present if there is a
 *   single specific moment in time at which the change was made. As a
 *   counter-example, instances of this class which are created by composing
 *   multiple other changes will not typically have a timestamp.
 *
 * * an optional ID of the author, which identifies the entity who created the
 *   change. As with the timestamp, this is only present if there is a single
 *   unique author of a change. As a counter-example, some changes are created
 *   "spontaneously" by the system (e.g. the empty first change to a document)
 *   and as such have no author.
 *
 * Instances of (subclasses of) this class are both consumed and produced by the
 * various "snapshot" classes.
 *
 * Instances of this class are immutable.
