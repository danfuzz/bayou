 * Base class for singletons (classes for which there is ever but a single

 * property for accessing the singleton instance.
 *
 * Subclasses must define a no-argument constructor.
 *
 * JavaScript being prototype-based, it might be considered odd to bother
 * definining singletons per se. Nonetheless, the pattern can turn out to be
 * handy, particularly when it is necessary to defer instantiation until after
 * the system is running. (That is, it is often either incorrect or at least
 * inappropriate to initialize an effective-singleton at the time the class is
 * being `import`ed.)
