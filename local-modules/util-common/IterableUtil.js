  /**
   * Coerces an iterable-which-might-be-an-iterator into an iterable that is
   * presumed safe to use more than once. Specifically:
   *
   * * Normal iterables are returned as-is.
   * * If given an iterable which also appears to support the `Iterator`
   *   protocol, returns a new iterable which is guaranteed to only iterate
   *   using the originally-passed value once. The new iterable will only call
   *   through to the original on an as-needed basis; that is, it doesn't just
   *   collect the full iteration results up-front.
   *
   * **Context:** The values returned from built-in iteration methods such as
   * `Map.values()` and `Object.entries()` are both `Iterator`s and `Iterable`s,
   * but when used as an iterable, they are _not_ safe to use more than once.
   * So, code that generically accepts an iterable-in-general and expects to
   * iterate using it more than once needs to do _something_ to ensure that it
   * doesn't get undermined by this oddball behavior. This method is one way to
   * get the necessary protection.
   *
   * @param {Iterable} iterable The iterable to ensure safe multiple-use of.
   * @returns {Iterable} `iterable` itself, if safe, or a new instance if not.
