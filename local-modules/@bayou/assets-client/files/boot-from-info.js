// This file is what should be included from an HTML page which wishes to
// become/embed a Bayou editor. It assumes that the `window` object (that is,
// the global context) contains the following bindings:
//
// * `BAYOU_INFO` -- The JSON-encoded form of an instance of `SessionInfo` or
//   `SplitKey`, to be used to identify and authenticate access to a particular
//   document.
// * `BAYOU_NODE` -- The DOM node into which the editor should be embedded.
// * `BAYOU_RECOVER` (optional) -- Function to use when attempting to recover
//   from connection trouble. It gets passed the `SessionInfo` or `SplitKey`
//   which was initially used to establish the connection.
//
// See {@link @bayou/top-client/TopControl} for more details about these
// parameters.

// Disable Eslint, because this file is delivered as-is and has to be fairly
// conservative.
/* eslint-disable */

// We wrap everything in an immediately-executed function so as to avoid
// polluting the global namespace.

    throw new Error('Missing configuration.');
  }

  // Grab the base URL out of the encoded info. This is kinda gross, but when
  // we're here we haven't yet loaded the API code, and in order to load that
  // code we need to know the server URL, whee! So we just do the minimal bit of
  // parsing needed to get the URL and then head on our merry way. See
  // {@link @bayou/api-common/SessionInfo} and
  // {@link @bayou/api-common/SplitKey}, the encoded forms in particular, if you
  // want to understand what's going on.
