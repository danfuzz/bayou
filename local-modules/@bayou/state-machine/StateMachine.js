/**
 * Lightweight state machine framework. This allows a subclass to define
 * handlers for any number of (state, event) pairs, along with default handlers
 * for wildcards on either event or state (or both). Events can be queued up
 * at will and get dispatched asynchronously (each in a separate turn) with
 * respect to the act of enqueueing, in the same order they were enqueued.
 *
 * Event handlers are allowed to be `async` functions, in which case they are
 * serialized such that there is only ever one handler running at a time,
 * including pauses due to handler-internal `await`s. That is, each invoked
 * handler runs to completion before another handler is invoked.
 *
 * The state machine is defined by a set of instance methods defined by
 * subclasses, with particular schematic names:
 *
 * * A method of the form `_check_<name>` is taken to be a validator for the
 *   event with the given name. It is called with the would-be event arguments,
 *   and it should return regularly if the arguments are valid, or throw an
 *   exception if the arguments are somehow invalid. The set of validators in
 *   effect defines the set of valid event names for the instance. If it returns
 *   regularly, it is expected to either return `undefined` or an array; in the
 *   latter case the return value is used as the event arguments instead of the
 *   ones originally supplied.
 *
 * * A method of the form `_handle_<stateName>_<eventName>` is taken to be the
 *   handler for the named event in the named state. It gets called with the
 *   same arguments as passed to the event queue function for the given event
 *   name. The set of states named in these methods defines the set of valid
 *   states for the instance.
 *
 *   As a special case, `any` may be used for either a state name or an event
 *   name (or both) in a handler, which causes the method to be used if there is
 *   no more specific handler. In the case of an `any` event name, the event
 *   name itself is prepended to the event arguments. **Note:** If there are
 *   matching handlers for both (state, any-event) and (any-state, event), then
 *   the former "wins."
 *
 * Constructing an instance will cause the instance to have two methods added
 * per named event, `q_<name>` and `p_<name>`, each of which takes any number of
 * arguments and queues up a new event (and does nothing else; e.g. doesn't
 * cause synchronous dispatch of events). `q_*` methods do normal FIFO queueing,
 * and `p_*` methods do LIFO pushing (which can be useful when an event handler
 * wants to guarantee transition to a new state with a known event at the head
 * of the queue).
 *
 * Similarly, a method is added for each state, `s_<name>`, each of which takes
 * no arguments and causes the machine to switch into the so-named state.
 *
 * Lastly (and also similarly), a method is added for each state, `when_<name>`,
 * each of which takes no arguments and returns a promise which becomes resolved
 * the moment the machine switches into the so-named state. (If the machine is
 * already in the named state at the moment of the `when_*` call, the promise is
 * immediately resolved.)
 *
 * This class defines a single event type `error(exception)`, which gets
 * queued up any time a handler throws an otherwise uncaught exception. This
 * class also defines two handlers: (1) a default handler for (any, any), which
 * throws an exception. (2) a default handler for (any, error), which logs the
 * error and aborts the state machine.
