@bayou/server-top
=================

This module contains most of the top level server code, including parsing of
command-line options. The intent is for this to have everything needed to
handle server invocation _except_ for injected dependencies.

**TODO:** This module is a work-in-progress and does not yet contain as much
code as it ultimately should.
