 * class represents the authority to emit events on a particular chain (as
 * opposed to it being functionality exposed on `ChainedEvent` itself).
 *
 * As a bridge between traditional JavaScript event handling, this class
 * provides the property {@link #emitter}, which is an instance of the standard
 * class `EventEmitter` for use only to _listen for_ events (but not directly
 * emit them). This allows for the traditional `on()` and `off()` calls,
 * synchronous callbacks to added listeners, and so on. It is worth noting that
 * the usage pattern that `EventEmitter` encourages leads naturally to a
 * difficult-to-mitigate garbage accumulation issue (of effectively dead
 * listeners), and for that reason it is advisable to stick with the modern
 * promise-based approach primarily offered by this class.
 *
 * **Note:** This class does _not_ remember any events ever emitted by itself
 * other than the most recent, because doing otherwise would cause a garbage
 * accumulation issue. (Imagine a single instance of this class being actively
 * used during a session which lasts for, say, a month.)
