   * optional set of multi-target delete operations (which is `null` for
   * document composes and required for non-document composes).
   *
   * **Note:** The deal with the `deletes` set is that multi-target deletes, in

   * an effect when the composition result is itself used as the argument to
   * a later compose operation. (Single-target deletes can always be dropped if
   * they are "overwritten" by a later write operation with the exact same ID.)
   *
   * **Note the Second:** This implementation does not necessarily produce a
   * "canonical" or maximally compact result with regards to multi-target delete
   * operations, because (a) it does not try to remove redundancies from within
   * the deletes other than recognizing `deleteAll` as mooting the whole set
   * (e.g., `deletePathRange('/x', 1, 6)` and `deletePathRange('x/', 4, 10)`
   * would ideally combine to `deletePathRange('/x', 1, 10)`); and (b) it does
   * not trim / remove delete operations that intersect with subsequent writes
   * (e.g., `deletePathRange('/x', 1, 10)` followed by `writePath('/x/1')`
   * would ideally trim the resulting delete to
   * `deletePathRange('/x', 2, 10)`).
