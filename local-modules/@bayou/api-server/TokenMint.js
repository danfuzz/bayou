 * validation. This class also provides a method to register tokens created via
 * other means, so as to avoid reusing the IDs of those tokens.
 *
 * The pattern of the full token form used by this class is
 * `<tag>-<id>-<secret>`, where `<tag>` is an arbitrary but fixed string of
 * lowercase characters, and where `<id>` and `<secret>` are both lowercase
 * hexadecimal numbers of configurable length.
 *
 * **Note:** This class is mostly intended for use in a development
 * configuration, but it is possible to use it in a simple production
 * deployment (e.g. one that doesn't need to deal with communicating tokens
 * across multiple back-end machines, nor one that wishes to have tokens be more
 * durable than OS processes).
