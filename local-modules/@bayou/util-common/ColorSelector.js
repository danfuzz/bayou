/**
 * Generator of an unending progression of colors. The original

 * in an IM app. It's good for tasks like that.
 *
 * It operates by walking its way around the HSL color wheel. By default it
 * rotates 53Â° around the circle for each new color. That allows you to generate
 * 7 colors before reusing large areas of hue, and even then, the primality of
 * the stride is such that you'll still get hundreds of distinct colors before
 * obvious duplicates are generated.
 *
 * The V component of each color is 87.5% which puts all of the colors in the
 * pastel range.
