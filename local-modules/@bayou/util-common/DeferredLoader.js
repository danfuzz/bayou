/**
 * Creator of "deferred loaders," in the form of a proxy handler class. A
 * deferred loader instance is a proxy which is initially "empty," and then
 * becomes populated the first time an attempt is made to access it. During the
 * first access, it calls on a loader function to load up the "real" target, and
 * then it uses that target for all accesses.
 *
 * The easiest way to use this class is via the {@link
 # BaseProxyHandler#makeProxy()} static method.
 *
 * The point of this class is to help break module dependency cycles. By using
 * this class, it is possible to effectively "import" a module just before it is
 * used, which can be _after_ it is fully initialized. This makes it so that the
 * imported module can actually depend on the module doing the loading (as long
 * as it doesn't _immediately_ use circularly-depended functionality).
